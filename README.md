I picked this dataset because knowing about climate change and our planet is important to me. As we talked about in class, things such as the prescense of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are much more studied and talked about than the prescence of methane in our atmosphere and on Earth. This dataset looks at the concentration of methane in different rivers. The specific column I used is the water tempature (measured in micromoles per liter). The temperature of the water is an important contextual statistic when considering what would be normal amounts of methane in river water.
